## ðŸš€ About Me
I am an ambitious individual with extensive experience in network configuration and maintenance, which I gained
while working with several companies in Croatia. However, I have transitioned from network engineering and am
now in my final year at Algebra University, where I have developed numerous web, desktop, and mobile applications
using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. My favorite programming languages are Java and C#. At
Algebra, I have also learned best practices for system design, clean code, and SOLID principles, further enhancing my
software development skills. I am particularly interested in becoming a backend engineer, where I can apply my
passion for building robust, scalable systems. This shift reflects my commitment to continually expanding my
technical expertise in software engineering.
# Nutrio App Frontend

This is the Vue.js client application for my final thesis.

The Nutrio software solution is designed to help users manage their diet and maintain health, especially in the context of increasingly unhealthy eating habits in today's fast-paced world. The solution offers personalized meal plans and recipes, taking into account users' health issues, allergies, and available ingredients. Unlike existing solutions on the market, Nutrio generates recipes based on ingredients users already have and warns about potentially harmful foods. By utilizing advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, Nutrio helps users adopt healthier eating habits, thereby improving their overall health. In the development of this work Vue.js was used for the client application, along with a Spring Boot REST server and a MongoDB database.
